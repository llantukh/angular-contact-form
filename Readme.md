#Contact List - Angular

#### Instructions

Create a contact form with the following fields: name, email, website and message. The form should also have a submit button. As the user is typing, it should validate all of the form fields and show any errors in the form data.

Once you have a correctly filled out form, you should send the info to the class server.

Below the contact form, it should list out all of the contacts in a nicely styled fashion. Those contacts should be persistent.
